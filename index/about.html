                        <b><i>Stage Fright</i></b> is an up-and-coming alternative rock band with five unique members: <i>Lucy</i>, <i>Lily</i>, <i>Haley</i>, <i>Salemn</i>, and <i>Kaitlyn</i>. These people all started as childhood friends or academic rivals but have become a group unbound by their passion for music. 
                        </p> <p class="BoutTime">
                        The band's story officially starts in 2020 with the Coronavirus looming over everyone's head. The members may have met each other in different ways, but they all met at the same time at an event at the university they were attending. It was at the annual Festival of Music and Art, where that year, the Festival was hosting its first Talent Show for any student of musical or non-musical talent. Five students who signed up for the talent show are future members of Stage Fright. But some of their intentions were not in the good of their heart.
                        </p><p class="BoutTime">
                        When Salemn performed their piece, Haley decided to sabotage their show first. Haley used her drum set to disrupt Salemn’s melody, causing Salemn to mess up. Even when Salemn stopped, Haley continued to play before Salemn rejoined, which surprised both the watchers and Haley. It was not a great start when Haley wanted to create a disaster, and Salemn wanted to reel the strings of chaos back in place. But, soon, the sounds of chaos and equilibrium intertwined, making a rift unlike before. However, the show was about to be interrupted one more time. By no other than the last members of Stage Fright, Lily, Kaitlyn, and Lucy.
                        </p><p class="BoutTime">
                        They had heard the song of chaos as they waited their turn to perform and got jealous—making them blind to their future actions. The trio began to play behind the curtains, not realizing that the show organizers were watching them. The band later said that the show organizers believed that this was all supposed to be happening despite the falter playing from Salemn and Haley. Due to that belief, the show organizers opened the curtains, revealing the trio. It was awkward with the five staring at each other, especially with Lucy under the bright lights and Kaitlyn and Lily cloaked still by shadows.
                        </p><p class="BoutTime">
                        A friend of the future band said "<i>It was so awkward during the talent show. Poor Lucy got red from realizing she was getting all the attention underneath the lights</i>".
                        </p><p class="BoutTime">
                        There had been no information about the future band after the “Talent Show Incident” for a couple of months and no sign of any hostility--other than the usual rivalry between Salemn and Haley--until November. A junior said she saw the group all settled in an empty music hall, talking amongst each other with a pile of papers on a table near them. No one believed the student until December when the university hosted a winter event and the young women stood as one on the stage. The students and facility say, at the end of the winter event, that it was tense and almost awkward in the beginning as if they were beginning to get cold feet. But then the music began to play, and the tension started to fade as they balanced each other out and let their practice and feelings lead them throughout the song.
                        </p><p class="BoutTime">
                        —----------—
                        </p><p class="BoutTime">
                        Stage Fright took that name when reminded of their insecurities being on stage at the winter event. Despite their growth from the faint fear of being on stage, they hold onto the name as a reminder of how far they come to this day.
                        </p><p class="BoutTime">
                        The band has released six albums and five singles thus far, and more music is coming in the future!

                            <p>In September, the group meets each other during a talent show hosted by their university. In November, the five officially 
                                banded together and did their first small concert for their university in December. They also earn their name <i>Stage Fright</i>
                                from a colleague.
